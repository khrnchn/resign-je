# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

"Resign Je" is a Malaysian-themed resignation platform built as a humorous inside-joke project. It's a React SPA that gamifies the resignation experience with profiles, awards, and interactive features.

## Development Commands

- `npm run dev` - Start development server (Vite)
- `npm run build` - Build for production (TypeScript compilation + Vite build)
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint checks
- `npm run preview` - Preview production build locally

## Architecture

### Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Routing**: React Router v6
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with purple theme
- **State Management**: React hooks (useState, useEffect)
- **Build Tool**: Vite
- **Icons**: Material Icons, Heroicons, Lucide React

### Key Components Structure
- `App.tsx` - Main app with routing and responsive sidebar
- `LandingPage.tsx` - Homepage with Malaysian theme
- `DeveloperList.tsx` - Hall of fame for resignees
- `AwardsConfig.tsx` - Awards management
- `ShouldIResign.tsx` - Interactive resignation decision game
- `Settings.tsx` - User preferences

### Data Layer
- **Mock Data**: All data is currently mock data in `src/lib/mockData.ts`
- **Types**: TypeScript interfaces in `src/types.ts` for Developer, Award, DeveloperAward
- **Hooks**: Custom hooks in `src/lib/hooks.ts` for data fetching and metadata management

### Metadata System
- Dynamic page metadata updates via `src/lib/metadata.ts`
- SEO optimization with OpenGraph and Twitter Card support
- Route-based metadata configuration

### Responsive Design
- Mobile-first approach with collapsible sidebar
- Breakpoints: mobile (`md:hidden`) and desktop (`md:`)
- Purple theme (`bg-purple-900`, `bg-purple-950`)

## Code Conventions

### Styling
- Use Tailwind CSS classes exclusively
- Purple color scheme: `purple-900`, `purple-950`, `purple-300`
- Responsive utilities: `md:` prefix for desktop breakpoints
- Mobile-first design approach

### Component Patterns
- Functional components with hooks
- Props destructuring in component signatures
- TypeScript interfaces for all prop types
- Material Icons for UI elements

### File Organization
- Components in `/src/components/`
- Utilities and hooks in `/src/lib/`
- Type definitions in `/src/types.ts`
- Mock data centralized in `/src/lib/mockData.ts`

## Malaysian Theme Elements

The app incorporates Malaysian cultural elements:
- ðŸ‡²ðŸ‡¾ flag emoji in branding
- "Je" suffix (Malaysian slang)
- Local developer profiles with Malaysian locations
- Playful resignation-themed awards and achievements
